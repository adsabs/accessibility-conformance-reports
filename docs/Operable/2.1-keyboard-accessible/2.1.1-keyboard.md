## Notes

- This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not.
- This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.
